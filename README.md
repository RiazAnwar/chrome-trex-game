# chrome-trex-game
A game made in pure javaScript HTML and CSS


Hello and welcome to another JavaScript Game Walkthrough!

In this walkthrough, I show you how to build the popular Dino Chrome Game in pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS, no fancy frameworks required! We also will not be using Canvas, we are going to be using pure JavaScript logic for everything!

I like this tutorial as we really focus on nodes, so adding Children to parents using .appendChild(), but also removing them using .removeChild() and a few others.


Thanks for coding along with me! I would love to see your finished games, how you have taken them to that extra level!
